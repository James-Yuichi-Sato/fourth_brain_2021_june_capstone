# Smart Annotation Pipeline for Video Sequences

## Fourth Brain 2021 June Capstone

## Project Description

In this project, our aim is to improve the video annotation workflow by removing redundant frames in video, as well as removing noisy frames and gaining insights into the videos using ML model detection.

We developed the workflow using the dashcam videos openly available in the [JAAD Dataset](https://github.com/ykotseruba/JAAD).

This workflow is intended to provide insight to improve the data extraction - data validation - data preparation stages in an MLOps workflow.
